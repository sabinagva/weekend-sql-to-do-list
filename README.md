## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?
1. It was hard for me to get the background color work since my status section was hard coded. I ended up using jquery function in render to dom where I stated every td that contains true gets background color
-then i faced a new challenge bc if my task contained true it would also become green
-so i ended up giving my td a class to prevent that

2. I also figured a new way of not having to reload the page every time when adding a new task by adding locationReload in post function after new input is being posted

3. sort function was used to prevent tasks being reordered when updating
